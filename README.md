# phishing-detection-system
Overview
Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, tricking users into revealing sensitive information by mimicking legitimate websites. This project aims to develop a Phishing Detection System using a Hybrid Machine Learning Approach to analyze and classify URLs as legitimate or phishing based on various extracted features.

Features
✅ Extracts key URL-based features (domain name, length, special characters, SSL status, etc.).
✅ Implements Machine Learning algorithms to classify URLs.
✅ Uses Hybrid ML approach (combining different models) for improved accuracy.
✅ Provides a real-time detection system to identify suspicious URLs.
✅ Scalable and can be extended with WHOIS, DNS, and webpage content analysis.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Models: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
Libraries Used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
Dataset: Open-source datasets from PhishTank, UCI ML Repository
How It Works?
Feature Extraction: Collect and preprocess URL-based features.
Training Machine Learning Models: Train different classifiers to detect phishing websites.
Hybrid Model Integration: Combine multiple models to improve detection accuracy.
Real-time Prediction: Use trained models to classify new URLs.
